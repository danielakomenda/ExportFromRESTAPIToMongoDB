This is a seperate Class for a maven spring-boot-application to access the data from the RESTAPI and store it in a mongoDB-collection.

It is part 4 of the final project for Data-Management-Class at ZHAW.

Since it is a difficult task and was not part of the lecture, I hope my solution will help you.
